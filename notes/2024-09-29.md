Played a game today to bug test the app. Made a few fixes:
- cemetary sorting: when dragging cards to the cemetary, the ordering will be correct
- bug fix: when adjusting mana, the board would clear
- untap all: click u on the keyboard
- banished: can now banish cards from cemetary
- precon defaults: added all the precons to the deck loader as defaults


Idea for new landing:

Simplify the landing, ditch the ai images. Prioritize:
- top site start games
- middle explainer 1,2,3
- how to use app FAQ accordion: text & webp videos
    - load deck (video of curiosa > solo)
    - Grid on browser (video of dragging cards and preview)
    - right click cards for options (video of counter, video of return discard)
    - click ? for commands
    - right click grid for tokens
